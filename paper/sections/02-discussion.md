Tools for reproducible research and their roles


* Makefile
	* Definition: GNU Make, commonly known as make, is a Unix tool that is part of the GNU Project. Make is a "tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files."
	* Role in the workflow: is part of the Automation tool of reproducible research, and it only executes the thing that are changed and hence is able to track timestamps.

* Git
	* Definition: Git is a free open source distributed version control system used to handle variety of projects with speed and efficiency.
	* Role in the workflow: is part of the Versino control tool of reproducible research, and it keeps track of changes over time, allows to track progress, access earlier versions, and collaborate with others.

* Github
	* Definition: GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git and also its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
	* Role in the workflow: is part of the Versino control tool of reproducible research, and it is a web-based Git repository which functions similar as Git in version control of projects.

* pandoc
	* Definition: Pandoc is a free and open-source software document converter, which is often used as a writing tool for publishing workflows and convert versions between Markdown, LaTex and html.
	* Role in the workflow: is part of the Literate computing, authoring, and publishing tool of reproducible research, and it is usually used for converting files to different versions such as Markdown, Latex, and html, and publishing workflows.

* Markdown
	* Definition: Markdown is a common way to write content for the web, which uses plain text formatting so that it can be converted to html or other formats.
	* Role in the workflow: is part of the Literate computing, authoring, and publishing tool of reproducible research, and serves as a converter to different formats.

Personal Experience of learning

Through the courses so far, I have learned the foundation tools for reproducible research such as version control tools and automation tools. The project is a great opportunity to review the concepts learned in lecture and use them in practice, which I found really engaging! Since the techniques used for the project are all covered in lectures and labs, it isn't tricky and definitely doable and useful. The hardest part for me personally is the Makefile and pandocs part since I am not really familiar with its syntax and use, while Git and Markdown are relatively easier for me since I have worked with them before and am more familiar with the subjects. I worked individually for this project and it takes me about seven to eight hours including reviewing concepts and finding resources. Overall, the project serves as a great chance to review the concepts I learned so far and I find it really interesting.
