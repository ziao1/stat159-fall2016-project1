# Stat 159 Project 1

## Abstract
In this project, I will summary the main things we learn in the course so far and my personal experience of study. Topics include but are not limited to the use of Makefile, Git, Github, pandoc and Markdown. The project will contain four parts: the abstract part, introduction part, discussion part and conclusion part. With these parts combined, we will be able to explore some foudation knowledge and basics of reproducible data science research and workflow.

This is a typical data analysis cycle which contains getting raw unstructured datasets, data cleaning and processment, exploratory data analysis, modeling and tuning parameters, visualization of results, report and presentation. 

In order to acheive this level of data analysis, we need to cooperate with other people and learn how to do reproducible research that allow other people to reproduce the work and work on the subject. In the later sections of the project, I will introduce some basics of reproducible research cycle.
