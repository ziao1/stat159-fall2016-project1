## Introduction

Reproducible Research

* Definition: is the concept that data analysis, or scientific researches, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them

* Types of Reproducible Research
	* Computational Reproduibility: detailed information is provided about code, software and implementation details
	* Empirical Reproducibility: when detailed information is provided about non-computational empirical scientific experiments and observations.
	* Statistical Reproducibility: when detailed information is provided about the choice of statistical tests, model parameters, threshold values and sampling procedures

* Useful tools for reproducible research
	* Literate computing, authoring, and publishing. These tools enable writing and publishing self-contained documents that include narrative and code used to generate both text and graphical results. These tools include Markdown, pandocs, Latex and IPython Notebook.
	* Version Control: These tools enable you to keep a record of file changes over time, so we can access specific versions of record. The most common tools used for version control is git combined with online services like Github and Bitbucket.
	* Automation: Several Unix tools are useful for streamlined automation and documentation of the research process,including editing files, compling documents and recording workflow. Common tools are GNU make and shell programs. 


In this project, I will introduce the definition and applications of some of the most common tools mentioned above, including Makefile, Git, Github, pandoc, and Markdown, and my own experience of using them.
